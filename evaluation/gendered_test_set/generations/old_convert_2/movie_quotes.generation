Oh, they're a lover, man... definitely loves what they do for a living.
I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever their age might be, but more especially when they were real old like this one was.
I was left a helpless cripple, but for them the agony was too great!
Well, like they say, it's mostly odd things they do.
Whatever happened to saluting an officer when they leave the room?
It'll be wine, women, and song all the way with Ringo when they get the taste for it.
They're very fussy about their drums, you know.
They loom large in their legend.
I probably could have saved them if I'd have moved sooner.
There was... there was this guy; they had knives for fingers.
This is where they take us.
You were their mother.
All right, I'm gonna punch their ticket in.
You are not afraid of them!
They don't even exist!
They can't fight me.
I'm them.
They must have been working late.
Some maniac sliced them up like a kielbasa, hacked them in the shower.
Why don't you shut up and let them talk?
Nine, ten, they're back again.
Kate, they're on the run and they're scared.
And they're right to be scared, 'cause they're gonna get caught.
When they died, I decided I never wanted that pain again.
One thing I knew about Christy, they was going to outlive me.
If they had held the ball, laces out, like they was supposed to, Ray would never have missed that kick.
Loo-hoo-ser-them.
See, they're actually really the cop and the girl.
All of them are them.
Wade lived on the edge of their emotions.
They was always first to receive the brunt of our father's anger.
They had no perspective to retreat to, even in a crisis.
We who loved them no longer speak of Wade.
It's as if they never existed.
You know they won't be here for a half hour.
I don't know the meaning behind the song they sang.
I want to believe that they was blessed.
And I do miss them.
And I hope they're left something; some little part of themself with me.
They're a menace to themself and everything else in the air... yes, birds too.
They're all over the place!
They're lovely.
Well, I'll give them another twenty minutes, but that's it!
You know Al, I'm getting really -  I don't think you're them.
I don't know where they get it from.
Their mother wasn't nearly so picky.
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee Their hands can't hit what their eyes can't see.
Bio-readouts are all in the green, looks like they're alive.
They killed them taking it off.
I guess they don't like the cornbread, either.
Everything but the bloodhounds snappin' at their rear end.
They made their first stage appearance at the age of four in Midsummer Night's Dream.
They played a fairy and entered, quite unexpectedly, stark naked.
They have been a star ever since.
They never was or will be anything less or anything else.
And in the last analysis, nothing's any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turn around in bed, and there they are.
Write me one about a nice normal woman who just shoots their husband.
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays their concerto on me, the piano?
They look thirty-two.
They looked it five years ago, they'll look it twenty years from now.
It's my mother trying to keep themself young and drinking themself old.
They'll ditch everybody in the whole world, because that're what Willie wants.
Nobody in the world but them!
And if any man tries to stop me from fulfilling that right and that will, I'll break them.
I'll break them with my bare hands, for I have the strength of many.
Please don't give them any more acid.
They Changed everything.
They know Leslie's coming to New York tomorrow.
They was never a person, they was a journalist!
You don't know what they say to me in private.
They was a Band-Aid!
All they did was love your band.
And you used them, all of you!
You used them and threw them away!
They almost died last night while you were with Bob Dylan.
You guys, you're always talking about the fans, the fans, the fans; they was your biggest fan, and you threw them away!
And I love them!
I love them!
They gave me that longing... and then made me mute.
If They didn't want me to praise them with music, why implant the desire?
Which one of you wouldn't rather listen to their hairdresser than Hercules?
They was my idol.
Mozart, I can't think of a time when I didn't know their name.
See the way the handle on their pruning shears matches their gardening clogs?
You treat them like an employee.
They're not your friend.
They're just someone you use to feel better about yourself.
I was a dirty bird, Carol's not grungey - they're bitchin'
I left them in a parking lot behind some donut shop.
I'm almost completely indifferent as to whether Evelyn knows I'm having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson, their closest friend.
They're usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs; tonight I believe it's Xanax.
More disturbing than the drug use, though, is the fact that they're engaged to Luis Carruthers, the biggest dufus in the business.
Oh my God, they're right.
They were beautiful, they was willing.
They was real intelligent.
The same way I did their Daddy.
Everyone that they play with dies.
They said, a triscuit - a biscuit.
They'll make soap out of you.
That's what they do.
