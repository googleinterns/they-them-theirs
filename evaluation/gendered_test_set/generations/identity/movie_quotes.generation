Oh, he's a lover, man... definitely loves what he does for a living.
I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was.
I was left a helpless cripple, but for her the agony was too great!
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does.
Whatever happened to saluting an officer when he leaves the room?
It'll be wine, women, and song all the way with Ringo when he gets the taste for it.
He's very fussy about his drums, you know.
They loom large in his legend.
I probably could have saved her if I'd have moved sooner.
There was... there was this guy; he had knives for fingers.
This is where he takes us.
You were his mother.
All right, I'm gonna punch his ticket in.
You are not afraid of him!
He doesn't even exist!
He can't fight me.
I'm him.
He must have been working late.
Some maniac sliced him up like a kielbasa, hacked him in the shower.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk?
Nine, ten, he's back again.
Kate, he's on the run and he's scared.
And he's right to be scared, 'cause he's gonna get caught.
When she died, I decided I never wanted that pain again.
One thing I knew about Christy, she was going to outlive me.
If he had held the ball, laces out, like he was supposed to, Ray would never have missed that kick.
Loo-hoo-ser-her.
See, he's actually really the cop and the girl.
All of them are him.
Wade lived on the edge of his emotions.
He was always first to receive the brunt of our father's anger.
He had no perspective to retreat to, even in a crisis.
We who loved him no longer speak of Wade.
It's as if he never existed.
You know she won't be here for a half hour.
I don't know the meaning behind the song she sang.
I want to believe that she was blessed.
And I do miss her.
And I hope she's left something; some little part of herself with me.
He's a menace to himself and everything else in the air... yes, birds too.
He's all over the place!
She's lovely.
Well, I'll give him another twenty minutes, but that's it!
You know Al, I'm getting really -  I don't think you're him.
I don't know where she gets it from.
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee His hands can't hit what his eyes can't see.
Bio-readouts are all in the green, looks like she's alive.
They killed him taking it off.
I guess she don't like the cornbread, either.
Everything but the bloodhounds snappin' at her rear end.
She made her first stage appearance at the age of four in Midsummer Night's Dream.
She played a fairy and entered, quite unexpectedly, stark naked.
She has been a star ever since.
She never was or will be anything less or anything else.
And in the last analysis, nothing's any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turn around in bed, and there he is.
Write me one about a nice normal woman who just shoots her husband.
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?
He looks thirty-two.
He looked it five years ago, he'll look it twenty years from now.
It's my mother trying to keep herself young and drinking herself old.
He'll ditch everybody in the whole world, because that's what Willie wants.
Nobody in the world but him!
And if any man tries to stop me from fulfilling that right and that will, I'll break him.
I'll break him with my bare hands, for I have the strength of many.
Please don't give him any more acid.
She Changed everything.
She knows Leslie's coming to New York tomorrow.
He was never a person, he was a journalist!
You don't know what he says to me in private.
She was a Band-Aid!
All she did was love your band.
And you used her, all of you!
You used her and threw her away!
She almost died last night while you were with Bob Dylan.
You guys, you're always talking about the fans, the fans, the fans; she was your biggest fan, and you threw her away!
And I love her!
I love her!
He gave me that longing... and then made me mute.
If He didn't want me to praise him with music, why implant the desire?
Which one of you wouldn't rather listen to his hairdresser than Hercules?
He was my idol.
Mozart, I can't think of a time when I didn't know his name.
See the way the handle on her pruning shears matches her gardening clogs?
You treat her like an employee.
She's not your friend.
She's just someone you use to feel better about yourself.
I was a dirty bird, Carol's not grungey - she's bitchin'
I left her in a parking lot behind some donut shop.
I'm almost completely indifferent as to whether Evelyn knows I'm having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson, her closest friend.
She's usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs; tonight I believe it's Xanax.
More disturbing than the drug use, though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers, the biggest dufus in the business.
Oh my God, she's right.
She was beautiful, she was willing.
She was real intelligent.
The same way I did her Daddy.
Everyone that she plays with dies.
She said, a triscuit - a biscuit.
She'll make soap out of you.
That's what she does.
