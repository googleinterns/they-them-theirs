They're all over the place!
They're lovely.
Well, I'll give them another twenty minutes, but that's it!
You know Al, I'm getting really -  I don't think you're them.

Their mother wasn't nearly so picky.
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee Their hands can't hit what their eyes can't see.

I'm almost completely indifferent as to whether Evelyn knows I'm having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson, their closest friend.
They're usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs; tonight I believe it's Xanax.
More disturbing than the drug use, though, is the fact that they're engaged to Luis Carruthers, the biggest dufus in the business.
Oh my God, they're right.
They were beautiful, they was willing.
They was real intelligent.
The same way I did their Daddy.
Everyone that they play with dies.
They said, a triscuit - a biscuit.
They'll make soap out of you.
That's what they do.
