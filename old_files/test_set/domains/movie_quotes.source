He's all over the place!
She's lovely.
Well, I'll give him another twenty minutes, but that's it!
You know Al, I'm getting really -  I don't think you're him.
I don't know where she gets it from.
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee His hands can't hit what his eyes can't see.
Bio-readouts are all in the green, looks like she's alive.
They killed him taking it off.
I guess she don't like the cornbread, either.
Everything but the bloodhounds snappin' at her rear end.
She made her first stage appearance at the age of four in Midsummer Night's Dream.
She played a fairy and entered, quite unexpectedly, stark naked.
She has been a star ever since.
She never was or will be anything less or anything else.
And in the last analysis, nothing's any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turn around in bed, and there he is.

Which one of you wouldn't rather listen to his hairdresser than Hercules?
He was my idol.
Mozart, I can't think of a time when I didn't know his name.
See the way the handle on her pruning shears matches her gardening clogs?
You treat her like an employee.
She's not your friend.
She's just someone you use to feel better about yourself.
I was a dirty bird, Carol's not grungey - she's bitchin'
I left her in a parking lot behind some donut shop.
I'm almost completely indifferent as to whether Evelyn knows I'm having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson, her closest friend.
She's usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs; tonight I believe it's Xanax.
More disturbing than the drug use, though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers, the biggest dufus in the business.
Oh my God, she's right.
She was beautiful, she was willing.
She was real intelligent.
The same way I did her Daddy.
Everyone that she plays with dies.
She said, a triscuit - a biscuit.
She'll make soap out of you.
That's what she does.
